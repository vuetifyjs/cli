# Project Rules

## General
- This is a monorepo managed with `pnpm`.
- Use TypeScript for all code.
- Prefer `pnpm` for running commands.
- Follow the existing code style and patterns.

## Vuetify0
**IMPORTANT**: Vuetify0 is **NOT** a legacy version. It is a lightweight, modular, meta framework for building UI frameworks with Vue.js.

### Core Concepts
1. **Headless Atomic Components**
   - Unstyled Vue components (Atom, Avatar, Popover, Theme, Hydration, Step, BreakpointsRoot, etc.).
   - Expose only logic and state.
   - You control markup, classes, and design tokens.

2. **Composable Reactive Utilities**
   - Focused composables (useBreakpoints, useTheme, useStorage, useSelection, useTokens, useRegistry, observers, events, forms, keydown, locale, logger).
   - Share consistent patterns.
   - Fully tree-shakable.

3. **Extensible & Performant**
   - Core Primitives: `createContext`, `createPlugin`, `createTrinity`.
   - Adapter Hooks: logger, storage, locale, theme.
   - Hydration helpers.
   - Benchmarked registry/token systems enabling scalability.

## CLI Structure
- **packages/cli**: Main entry point for the `vuetify` command.
- **packages/create**: Logic for `create-vuetify`.
- **packages/v0-cli**: Logic for `vuetify0` CLI.
- **packages/shared**: Shared utilities, commands, and logic (downloading templates, i18n, etc.).
- **packages/vscode**: VS Code extension.

## Development
- Use `tsdown` for building packages.
- When adding new features to the CLI, consider if the logic belongs in `shared` to be reusable across `cli`, `create`, `v0-cli`, and `vscode`.
